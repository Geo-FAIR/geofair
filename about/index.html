      <h1>About GeoFAIR</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        GeoFAIR is building a community-governed, discipline-specific framework to
        support FAIR data practices across Earth and environmental sciences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The GeoFAIR project aims to convene, engage, and co-develop a critically-needed,
        low-tech, and sustainable framework for data sharing leading practices with
        three pilot geoscience disciplines: hydrology, oceans, and seismology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to empower these target disciplines to be knowledgeable of, and
        connected to, their community’s existing cyberinfrastructure resources,
        technologies, and leading practices, and to be proactive in effectively and
        efficiently managing and sharing FAIR research outputs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        For each pilot discipline (hydrology, oceans, seismology), GeoFAIR will deliver:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A discipline-specific, co-created data and digital object management
          resource hub structure, hosted on a neutrally branded web platform. The hub
          will be a place where community members can easily locate community-vetted,
          trusted data management practices, data repository information, and more.
          It will uplift existing efforts taking place in disparate organizations and
          initiatives around the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          A discipline-specific, co-created governance structure to ensure continued
          stewardship and updating of the resource hub. The governance structure will
          leverage existing community structures in global scientific societies and
          organizations to ensure success of the initiative beyond the GeoFAIR project
          period.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the conclusion of the project, informed by the experience of working with
        the three pilot disciplines, the GeoFAIR team will publish and socialize an
        openly available discipline toolkit containing implementation guidance for
        additional disciplines that are demonstrating community readiness.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Network Collaborator Committee</h2>
      <p>
        The GeoFAIR project benefits greatly from the expertise and oversight of an
        eight-member Network Collaborator Committee. The Committee is composed of
        leaders in the three pilot disciplines who possess a broad geoscience network
        and expertise in community engagement, change-making, and international
        initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        These leaders support the project PIs in grounding the work, informing the
        design of the framework, facilitating conversations with disciplinary
        community members, and informing the design of a long-term, focused plan for
        governing and updating each disciplinary resource hub.
      </p>
      <p>
        Representatives include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Peter Pissierssens (Ocean sciences)</li>
        <li>Justin Buck (Ocean sciences)</li>
        <li>Jordan Reed (Hydrology)</li>
        <li>Kyle Onda (Hydrology)</li>
        <li>Lesley Wyborn (Seismology)</li>
        <li>Helle Pedersen (Seismology)</li>
        <li>+ two additional collaborators to be announced</li>
      </ul>
